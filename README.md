# Multi-Grade-Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-interpretation-using-ExplainableAI
This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using deep learning models and includes explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret the model's predictions.
This repository contains the code for preprocessing data, models implemented using the Hydra configuration framework, results, and explainable methods for this project on brain tumor classification interpreting with explainable AI techniques. The project leverages deep learning models, particularly MobileNetV2, and utilizes the Captum library for model interpretability.


The top 5 best-performing model checkpoints are included in the Git repository. 
For the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, the winning model checkpoint 'MobileNetV2_2221311_0.3' was used.
