# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-Explainable-AI

This project focuses on classifying brain tumors using deep learning models and includes explainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret the model's predictions.

The top 5 best-performing model checkpoints are included in the Git repository. 
For the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, the winning model checkpoint 'MobileNetV2_2221311_0.3' was used.
